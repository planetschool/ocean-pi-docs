# Introduction

In this project, you will design and build a scientific buoy using real lab-grade instruments to monitor the ocean or other body of water of your choosing. 

This project will progress in phases that are each complete projects with each successive phase adding more features. Accompanying these additional features is added coding difficulty and added hardware, which means added expense. We believe that a very useful data gathering buoy can be completed with just completing the first phase.

## Phase 1: Water and atmospheric sensors

The first phase involves getting a functional sensor array. This system can be installed indoors to monitor water and air quality. We will have this most basic system installed on *Wonder* as part of the ship's flow through system where sea water is pumped past our sensors. We also are installing it in the kelp and oyster hatchery at Northeast Maritime Institute.

## Phase 2: Data display and dashboard

Being able to read the data being gathered by your sensors without having a monitor attached to your Raspberry Pi is essential for functionality. We will attach a LCD screen to the Raspberry Pi and stream the datafeed to an online dashboard that can be viewed publicly or privately. You can see our hatchery dashboard here.

## Phase 3: Adding a camera

It may not be useful to have a camera for strictly indoor air and water quality monitoring, but we make use of cameras in our hatchery. Plus, who doesn't want some visuals? For our buoy as well as our installation on *Wonder*, we need to create a waterproof housing for our camera.

## Phase 4: Outdoor installation with shore power and wifi

The third phase of this project takes our sensor array outside while still relying on wifi to get data from the buoy and a corded power supply. We will be installing ours next to the docks of the Northeast Maritime Institute. We will also add gyroscopic sensors to measure wave action.

## Phase 5: Cellular data

## Phase 6: Solar panels and battery power
