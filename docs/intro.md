# Getting Started with Tutorials

Welcome to Ocean Pi. We are still building this page and the tutorials as we build the Ocean Pi installations themselves. You can watch this project come to life through [our blog](/blog/), which includes short posts and longer updates, and/or subscribe to larger batches of updates on the [Ocean Pi substack newsletter](https://oceanpi.substack.com/). 

We began this project in 2024 with initial designs led by students at the Nueva School. We took these designs to sea on *Wonder's* maiden voyage along the Great Loop (you can see video of it [here](https://www.youtube.com/@planetschoolchannel)). With copious notes from our voyage in hand, we are getting back to work to build a sustainable oceanography project that is both educational and functional—we are working with real ocean scientists to ensure the systems we are building can usefully contribute to ocean research.

Thank you for visiting and keep checking in!
