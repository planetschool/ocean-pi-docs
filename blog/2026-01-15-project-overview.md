## Step #1 – Project Design & Planning ☑️
Timeline: Jan 15 – Jan 31, 2026
The project itself is the design, construction, deployment, and documentation of a coastal weather station and research buoy in the greater Fairhaven/New Bedford area. For this project, the starting point is identifying the fundamentals of who, what, where, when, and why. At this stage, the project includes Capt. Thane Robinson and I are the primary designers and builders. 
This project supports NMI's new aquaculture and ocean science program as well as offering an open-source model for public participation in generating real-world data. Both the data itself and the process of building the hardware are intended to be useful for students, teachers, and researchers  functioning as a legitimate long-term environmental monitoring tool and a curriculum tool for studying oceanography.
The project timeline follows a standard academic semester, with a goal to hit each major progress point in about two weeks. This schedule includes building, troubleshooting, and refining each project step. The final product will feature public documentation—similar to a blog—detailing materials, design choices, failures, and solutions, intended as a guide so others can replicate or adapt the system for their own use.
During this phase, final decisions will be made regarding:
Sensor selection
System architecture
Data goals
Power and communication strategies
Deployment locations and constraints

## Step #2 – Software Development & System Integration ☑️
Timeline: Feb 1 – Feb 14, 2026
During stage 2, we will focus on finalizing the software and integrating sensors with the Raspberry Pi and microcontrollers. We expect The buoy hardware and base code are mostly functional; remaining tasks include refining Python scripts to ensure all sensors operate within a stable program.
For the weather station, efforts center on fixing software bugs, calibrating sensors, and ensuring stable operation. Wiring practices—including pin assignments, communication protocols, and power distribution—will be documented.
By the end of this phase, both systems will be be capable of:
Continuously collecting data
Logging data locally
Transmitting data over WiFi (initially)
Recovering from power or communication interruptions
All software and wiring diagrams will be documented to ensure reproducibility.

## Step #3 – First Rendition & Initial Installation ☑️
Timeline: Feb 15 – Feb 28, 2026
Step 3 is the first real-world deployment of both systems. The initial buoy and weather station prototypes will use grid power and WiFi for simplicity and close monitoring during early operation.
This phase aims to validate systems, not achieve perfection. Data gathered will be used to assess:
Sensor accuracy and consistency
Physical durability of enclosures
Exposure-related issues (moisture, temperature, vibration)
Data transmission reliability
A focus on identifying any failures or weaknesses, which if found will guide future design changes. This phase is also the first chance to visualize and analyze real-world environmental data from the area.

## Step #4 – Second Rendition: Autonomous Systems
Timeline: Mar 1– Mar 21, 2026
Step 4 advances once baseline function is confirmed, then the project shifts to full independence. The buoy and weather station operate without grid power or WiFi.
This phase includes:
Adding solar panels and charge controllers
Integrating battery banks
Transitioning data transmission to cellular service
Improving power efficiency through software optimization
Simultaneously, work will begin on 3D modeling custom enclosures and mounting systems to optimize the design for both the buoy and station using design tools such as:
Tinkercad
Womp
Fusion 360 or FreeCAD
By the conclusion of this stage the goal is to be prepared for a more refined and durable third rendition.

## Step #5 – Third Rendition: Fabrication & Final Assembly
Timeline: Mar 22 – Apr 10, 2026
During  phase 5, the finalized designs are produced. Custom components will be 3D-printed for the buoy and weather station, enabling precise placement of sensors, electronics, and power systems.
Tasks include:
Printing and post-processing parts
Assembling final systems
Selecting and confirming final deployment locations
Researching and obtaining any necessary permits
Painting, labeling, and color-coding components for clarity and maintenance
This step transitions the project from prototype to near-final hardware ready for deployment

## Step #6 – Final Deployment, Analysis & Expansion
Timeline: Apr 11 – Apr 30, 2026
The final phase, phase 6, centers on deploying the completed buoy and station in their long-term locations. Final adjustments and calibrations will be made before and after deployment.
Once operational, attention will shift to:
Long-term data collection and analysis
Refining documentation into a publishable  public resource
Designing practical applications for educational institutions
Exploring potential economic or business models related to custom-built monitoring systems or data services
This phase includes reflecting on lessons learned and offering recommendations for future iterations or expansions.

## Project Phase Dates/Update Schedule Overview
Throughout the project, progress updates will be shared publicly on a weekly posting schedule via a dedicated blog and/or associated social media platform. Each weekly update will summarize any work completed during that period, highlighting any challenges encountered, and describing solutions, design changes, or lessons learned. Posts will include photos, diagrams, code snippets, and any data samples when appropriate. This consistent update schedule establishes clear expectations for the public who choose to join us on this journey, supports transparency, and creates a chronological record of the project from initial planning through final deployment.
